# React ToDo List

A simple ToDo list application built with React.

## Overview

This project is a minimal ToDo list app that helps you manage tasks efficiently. It was created as a practice project to explore the core concepts and features of [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## Features

- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks from your list
- Responsive and clean user interface

## Motivation

I built this ToDo list app to practice and improve my React skills. The main goals were to:

- Understand React component structure
- Learn about state management using React hooks
- Implement simple interactions and UI updates
